To predict the successful Marketing Campaign 

**Introduction** 

As a marketing analyst, I would like to figure out how to determine a successful marketing campaign and what factors influence the success of a marketing campaign. 

In terms of Marketing, a successful marketing campaign can be defined by 

- ROI (return of investment ), high ROI rating
- Convention rate
- customer engagement rate

However, it can depend on the purpose of the campaign.  

**Goal**

The main Objective of the Campaign is : 

Use historical marketing campaign data to predict whether a campaign will be successful based on features like channel, audience, engagement, cost, etc.

**Data Set** 

This project will use data set from Kaggle by following the link:
